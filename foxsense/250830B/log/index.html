[250802 Release]

[CHANGELOG]  
[+] Added some new visuals (explore them yourself!)  
[+] Improved readability for some blur and bloom classes  

[WARNINGS]  
- Starting from version 5.8, only the EXE launcher is provided  
- This version requires **Java JDK 18+** only!!!  
- Some users may need to add the `-noverify` JVM argument  
- This version is **x64-only** (Linux / Windows / MacOS). Do not try other systems.  

[NOTES]  
- Double-click install does not work: *"won't start, install me"*  
- If you think the EXE is suspicious, rename it to `.jar` and download the matching launch JSON file  
- It is recommended to add `-Dfile.encoding=UTF-8` to JVM arguments  
  (otherwise thereâ€™s a chance of console garbled text)
